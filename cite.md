How to cite PLUMED
-----------------------------
The development of open source software is not the work of a few core developers, but the effort of an entire community of users, developers, and contributors. In early 2019, we acknowledged this successfull working model by founding the [PLUMED consortium](http://www.plumed-nest.org/Members.html). In this spirit, we kindly ask you to use the following (or similar) wording in any work published using PLUMED:

*"This work was carried out using the open-source, community-developed PLUMED library [1], version 2.x [2] (or alternatively version 1.x [3])."*


**Additionally:**

- If you used one of the indepedent PLUMED modules, please also cite the appropriate reference(s)!

- If you deposited your data on [PLUMED-NEST](http://www.plumed-nest.org), we invite you to add the    following sentence to your manuscript: *"All the data and PLUMED input files required to reproduce the results reported in this paper can be found on PLUMED-NEST (www.plumed-nest.org), the public repository of the PLUMED consortium [1]"*.
