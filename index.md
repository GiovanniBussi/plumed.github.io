Welcome to the home of PLUMED!
-----------------------------

PLUMED is a freely-available, open-source library that provides a wide range of different methods that includes enhanced-sampling algorithms, free-energy methods, and tools to analyze the vast amounts of data produced by MD simulations. PLUMED is works together with some of the most popular molecular dynamics engines. Free-energy calculations can be performed as a function of many order parameters with a particular focus on biological problems, using state of the art methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based steered MD. The software, written in C++, can be easily interfaced with both fortran and C/C++ codes.
