PLUMED-NEST is the public repository of the PLUMED consortium. It provides all the data needed to reproduce the results of a PLUMED-enhanced molecular dynamics simulation (or analysis) contained in a published paper. Furthermore, PLUMED-NEST monitors the compatibility of the provided PLUMED input files with the current version of the code and integrates links from these files to the PLUMED manual.
