# plumed.github.io
Draft plumed.org website.

Here are some notes for updating the website

### Adding News
TODO

### Adding Releases
Just update the [_data/releases.yml](_data/releases.yml) file. In all places where version numbers are used (currently: the download section, the doc section, and the download button in the header) Jekyll variables are used in order to implement the correct links and texts.
