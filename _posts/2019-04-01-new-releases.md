It is a pleasure to announce two new PLUMED releases!

Release 2.5.1 is a maintenance release on the 2.5.x branch and solves a few bugs. See [here](http://goo.gl/EUUu4A). Notice that we solved a bug in the GROMACS2018 interface related to the number of OpenMP threads, in order to take advantage of the fix you might have to patch GROMACS again.

Release 2.4.5 is the last maintenance release on branch 2.4.x, see [here](http://goo.gl/TzqoMM).

You can find all releases in the [download](/download.html) section of the PLUMED webpage. They are also tagged on [GitHub](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2) (v2.5.1 and v2.4.5).
