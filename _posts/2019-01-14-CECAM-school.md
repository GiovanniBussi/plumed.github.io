The registration for the CECAM school "Open source software for enhanced-sampling simulations” is open!
It will be held in Lugano (Switzerland) from July 22 to July 27, 2019.

The school will be organized into two different parts:
* a 3-days tutorial that will involve lectures and hands-on sessions using PLUMED and the GROMACS, LAMMPS and CP2K codes. 
* a 3-days workshop in which the developers of various open-source software packages for enhanced-sampling and the developers and users of these enhanced-sampling methods will participate.

There will also be a poster session and contributed talks will be selected from the abstracts sent by the participants.

If you are interested, please apply on the [CECAM website](https://www.cecam.org/workshop1749/) and don’t forget to specify whether you are interested in attending both the tutorial and workshop or only the workshop part of the school.
